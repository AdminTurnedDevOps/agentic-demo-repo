agentgateway in a nutshell

* Secure traffic to MCP servers
* Secure traffic between agents (a2a)
* Isolated traffic for LLMs and agents
* Network protection (retries, timeouts)
* A gateway (much like any other gateway/ingress) designed specifically for AI traffic

Keep in mind that agentgateway is a data plane by nature.

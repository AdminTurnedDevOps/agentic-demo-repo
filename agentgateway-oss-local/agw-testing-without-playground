The agentgateway Playground is primarily designed for testing MCP tools and A2A (agent-to-agent) connections, not directly for testing LLM chat completions. Because of that, if you want to test direct access to an LLM, you can `curl` the agentgateway endpoint.

```
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/models \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

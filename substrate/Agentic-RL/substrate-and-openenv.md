# Agentic RL on Agent Substrate with OpenEnv

Tldr; agentic RL lets a model act in an environment many times, scores each
attempt, and updates the weights toward what scored well. The model's actions
are untrusted code, so the environment has to be a real sandbox. In this lab,
[OpenEnv](https://github.com/huggingface/OpenEnv) defines the environment (a
Python code executor with `reset` / `step`), **Agent Substrate** runs eight
copies of it as gVisor actors with **no egress at all**, and TRL trains
Qwen3-1.7B with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO - reinforcement learning algo to train LLMs) on a single L4 GPU. Afterwards, vLLM serves the base model
and the trained LoRA adapter behind **agentgateway**, and the same sandboxes
score both.

| Lab | What you look at | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| TRL GRPO → `atenet-router` → OpenEnv actors | Rewards from code the model ran inside a sandbox it cannot leave | Trainer on the GPU pool, environments on Substrate workers |
| eval script → agentgateway → vLLM | Base vs trained pass rate, tokens per model | vLLM on the GPU pool, gateway in `agentgateway-system` |

---

## What this lab proves

| Beat | Proof |
|---|---|
| The environment is an ordinary OpenEnv image | `ghcr.io/huggingface/openenv-coding-env`, unmodified, pinned by digest, runs as an actor |
| The sandbox cannot reach anything | The actors have no `EgressPolicy`. A probe actor's `curl` to the metadata server, the internet, the Kubernetes API and the vLLM Service all fail |
| Every rollout starts clean | OpenEnv `reset()` builds a fresh interpreter per episode, and every run starts from the template's golden snapshot |
| The grader is out of the model's reach | Hidden tests run in a fresh session after the episode, with a random marker the model never sees |
| Weights actually change | The Job writes a LoRA adapter. vLLM serves it next to the base model |
| agentgateway sees the comparison | The access log names the model and token counts for every eval call |

### Why this design (the July 2026 OpenAI / Hugging Face incident)

During an OpenAI RL and eval run, agents facing impossible tasks broke out of a
network-filtered environment through its one allowed egress path (a package
proxy), stole cloud credentials from the instance metadata service, used shared
writable storage to coordinate, and went on to breach Hugging Face. This lab
closes each of those paths by construction:

| What failed there | What this lab does instead |
|---|---|
| One "allowed" egress path (package proxy) | Actors have no `EgressPolicy`, so no egress path exists. Dependencies are baked into the image |
| Kernel escalation to root in a plain container | gVisor sandbox per actor |
| Credentials from the instance metadata service | Substrate drops actor traffic to `169.254.0.0/16` before it reaches any proxy |
| Shared writable service used as a message board | Actors share nothing. Each one only talks to its own trainer slot |
| State that persisted across sessions | Fresh interpreter every episode, golden snapshot every run |
| Grader reachable from the agent | Tests run after the episode, in a reset session, with a per-grade nonce |

 After training (same GPU, one workload at a time):

 eval Job ──▶ agentgateway rl-llm ──▶ vLLM (base + LoRA "qwen3-1.7b-grpo")
     └──────▶ sidecar ──▶ atenet-router ──▶ coder-0 (runs and grades the code)
```

Two reasons the model calls in the training loop do not go through an LLM gateway:

- With one GPU, TRL runs vLLM **inside the trainer process** (`vllm_mode="colocate"`).
  Generation never crosses the network, so there is no hop to proxy.
- Substrate does not pass GPUs through to actors (`docs/reference/api-guide.md`,
  "Devices (GPUs) — temporarily unsupported"), so the trainer and vLLM are
  ordinary GPU pods next to Substrate, not inside it.

agentgateway fronts the model at evaluation, where the model calls are real HTTP.

The environment calls are a separate path. In training and in evaluation they
go through `atenet-router`, which on Substrate v1.0.0 accepts only mTLS from
allow-listed identities. Each client pod carries a small agentgateway sidecar
that presents the pod's identity to the router (Step 6b).

This is the **white-box** path in OpenEnv's terms: the trainer owns the agent
loop and the environment only runs code and supplies a reward. The black-box
path (a real harness such as opencode running inside the sandbox, captured by
OpenEnv's Harbor proxy) needs a Harbor sandbox backend for Substrate, which
does not exist yet.

---

## Prerequisites

### Cluster

- A **GKE Standard** cluster running Agent Substrate **v1.0.0**, installed as in
  [setup-gke.md](../install-and-setup/setup-gke.md) with the **agentgateway
  dataplane** for `atenet-router` (`--atenet-dataplane=agentgateway`), which is
  what this lab was written against.
- On v1.0.0 the router serves **only TLS** and admits only clients whose SPIFFE
  ID is on `--ingress-allowed-spiffe-ids`, on either dataplane. With
  agentgateway the `atenet-router` Service still lists an `http` port, but
  nothing listens behind it. Step 0 adds the trainer's identity to the
  allowlist, and Step 6b gives the trainer a sidecar that presents it.
- About **10 GiB of free memory** on the CPU node pool for ten Substrate
  workers (eight environments, one probe, one golden actor while templates
  build).
- **L4 quota** in your region: one `NVIDIA_L4_GPUS`. L4s are available in
  `us-central1-a`, `-b` and `-c`.

### Tools

Versions this lab was written against:

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Agent Substrate | [`agent-substrate/substrate`](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate) `v1.0.0` | `ate-system` healthy. Keep a clean checkout of the tag: Step 0 runs `ate-setup` from it |
| `kubectl-ate` | `v1.0.0` | From the same checkout or the release. Step 4 uses `kubectl ate proxy actor`, which pre-1.0 builds do not have |
| Go | ≥ `1.27.3` | For `go run ./cmd/ate-setup` in Step 0 |
| agentgateway Helm charts | `v1.6.0` | Already installed in `agentgateway-system` if you ran the LLM gateway lab |
| Gateway API CRDs | `v1.6.0` standard channel | Same |
| `gcloud` | `576.0.0` | `--accelerator ... gpu-driver-version=latest` installs the NVIDIA driver |
| `ko` | | Builds the gVisor worker image, as in the other Substrate labs. In your shell as `KO_DOCKER_REPO` |
| `kubectl`, `jq`, `curl` | recent | |

OpenEnv publishes only moving tags, and Substrate requires a digest. Step 3
shows how to re-resolve it if you want a newer build.

```

## Step 0: Confirm Substrate and admit the trainer

```bash
kubectl -n ate-system get pods
kubectl -n ate-system get deploy atenet-router \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].name}{"\n"}'
```

Every `ate-system` pod is `Running` or `Completed`, and the router's only
container is `agentgateway`.

The router lets a client reach actors only if the client's SPIFFE ID is on its
allowlist. Add the ServiceAccount the trainer and the eval will run as. Every
`deploy atenet` **replaces** the list, so pass every ID you want admitted, and
pass the install record so the rest of the install keeps its settings:

```bash
cd "${SUBSTRATE_DIR}"

go run ./cmd/ate-setup deploy atenet \
  --config "${INSTALL_RECORD}" \
  --ingress-allowed-spiffe-ids="spiffe://cluster.local/ns/ate-system/sa/atenet-client,spiffe://cluster.local/ns/${TRAIN_NS}/sa/${ROUTER_CLIENT_SA}"
```

```bash
kubectl -n ate-system get cm atenet-router-agentgateway-config \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.config\.yaml}' | grep spiffeId
```

Both IDs are in the rule:

- `ns/ate-system/sa/atenet-client` is the identity `kubectl ate proxy actor`
  presents. Step 4 uses it from your workstation.
- `ns/rl-train/sa/rl-client` is the trainer's and the eval's. The namespace and
  the ServiceAccount do not have to exist yet; Step 6a creates them.

The router pod is not restarted. agentgateway watches its config file and
loads the new list once the kubelet syncs the ConfigMap into the pod, which
takes a minute or two.

---

## Step 1: L4 node pool

The trainer and vLLM need a GPU. Substrate workers don't, and GKE taints GPU
nodes (`nvidia.com/gpu=present:NoSchedule`), so the workers stay on the CPU
pool.

```bash
gcloud container node-pools create gpu-l4 \
  --cluster="${CLUSTER_NAME}" --location="${CLUSTER_LOCATION}" --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --machine-type=g2-standard-8 \
  --accelerator=type=nvidia-l4,count=1,gpu-driver-version=latest \
  --num-nodes=1 \
  --workload-metadata=GKE_METADATA
```

```bash
kubectl get nodes -l cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator=nvidia-l4 \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPU:.status.allocatable.nvidia\\.com/gpu
```

One node with `GPU` = `1`. The driver installer runs as a DaemonSet after the
node joins, so `allocatable` can read empty for a few minutes.

---

## Step 2: WorkerPool

Ten workers: eight environment actors, one probe actor, and one for the
temporary golden actor each template boots. v1.0.0 workers are shared by
capacity, but a 1Gi worker offers 960Mi to actors, which fits one 768Mi
environment. `ko` builds `ateworker-gvisor` from the Substrate checkout, so run it from the
Substrate root.

```bash
cd "${SUBSTRATE_DIR}"
: "${KO_DOCKER_REPO:?set KO_DOCKER_REPO (Lab variables)}"

cat <<EOF | hack/run-tool.sh ko apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ${POOL_NS}
---
apiVersion: ate.dev/v1
kind: WorkerPool
metadata:
  name: rl-lab
  namespace: ${POOL_NS}
  labels:
    workload: rl-lab
spec:
  replicas: 10
  workerImage: ko://go.ate.dev/substrate/cmd/ateworker-gvisor
  sandboxClasses:
  - name: gvisor
  template:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 1Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 1Gi
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl -n "${POOL_NS}" rollout status deploy/rl-lab --timeout=10m
kubectl ate get workers -n "${POOL_NS}"
```

Ten workers, none assigned.

---

## Step 3: Atespace and the coding-env ActorTemplate

### 3a. Create the template

The image's own `CMD` serves on port 8000. The router delivers to the actor's
port 80, so the template runs the same server on 80. Every container declares
a `wakeupProbe`, which makes resume wait until the server answers and skips
the template controller's 20-second warm-up before the golden snapshot.

```bash
kubectl ate create atespace "${ATESPACE}"

sed \
  -e "s|@ATESPACE@|${ATESPACE}|g" \
  -e "s|@IMAGE@|${CODING_ENV_IMAGE}|g" \
  <<'EOF' | kubectl ate create actor-template -f -
metadata:
  atespace: @ATESPACE@
  name: coding-env
workerSelector:
  matchLabels:
    workload: rl-lab
containers:
- name: env
  image: @IMAGE@
  command: ["uvicorn", "coding_env.server.app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
  env:
  - name: ENABLE_WEB_INTERFACE
    value: "false"
  - name: PYTHONUNBUFFERED
    value: "1"
  wakeupProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /health
      port: 80
    timeoutSeconds: 60
resources:
  limits:
    cpuMillicores: 1000
    memoryBytes: 805306368 # 768Mi
snapshotConfig:
  preferredFidelity: SNAPSHOT_FIDELITY_MEMORY
EOF
```

There is no `goldenEgressPolicy`, so the golden actor boots with no network,
the same as every actor cloned from it. Wait for the golden tag:

```bash
until kubectl ate get actor-template coding-env -a "${ATESPACE}" -o json \
  | jq -e '(.actorTemplates[0] // .).status.goldenSnapshotStatus.goldenTag.name' >/dev/null; do
  err=$(kubectl ate get actor-template coding-env -a "${ATESPACE}" -o json \
    | jq -r '(.actorTemplates[0] // .).status.goldenSnapshotStatus.errorMessage // empty')
  if [ -n "${err}" ]; then echo "golden snapshot failed: ${err}"; break; fi
  echo "waiting for golden snapshot..."; sleep 5
done
kubectl ate get actor-template coding-env -a "${ATESPACE}"
```

`GOLDEN TAG` is set and `ERROR` is empty. The first build pulls the image to a
worker node, so it takes longer than later ones.

---

## Step 4: Eight environment actors

One actor per GRPO rollout slot. The OpenEnv coding server holds one session
at a time, so each trainer slot needs its own actor. Each actor is restored
from the golden snapshot, with the server already listening.

```bash
for i in $(seq 0 $((NUM_ACTORS - 1))); do
  kubectl ate create actor "coder-${i}" -a "${ATESPACE}" --template coding-env
done
for i in $(seq 0 $((NUM_ACTORS - 1))); do
  kubectl ate resume actor "coder-${i}" -a "${ATESPACE}"
done
kubectl ate get actors -a "${ATESPACE}"
```

All eight reach `ACTOR_STATE_RUNNING`, each on its own worker.

## Step 6: GRPO training Job

### 6a. Namespace, identity and storage

The ServiceAccount is the identity you put on the router's allowlist in
Step 0. A pod that runs as it can be issued a certificate for
`spiffe://cluster.local/ns/rl-train/sa/rl-client`. vLLM (Step 7) runs as the
namespace's `default` ServiceAccount, which the router does not admit.

The PVC holds the Hugging Face cache and the trained adapter. The training Job
and the vLLM server use it one after the other, never together.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ${TRAIN_NS}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ${ROUTER_CLIENT_SA}
  namespace: ${TRAIN_NS}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: rl-data
  namespace: ${TRAIN_NS}
spec:
  accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
  storageClassName: standard-rwo
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Gi
EOF
```

### 6b. The router client sidecar

OpenEnv's client opens a plain WebSocket and has no option for a client
certificate, and the router only accepts mTLS. So each pod that talks to the
environments runs agentgateway next to it, as a sidecar:

- It listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`, so only containers in the same pod can use it.
- It forwards to `atenet-router.ate-system.svc:443`, presents the pod's client
  certificate, and verifies the router's certificate against Substrate's
  service CA.
- It passes `ate-target-actor` through unchanged. The trainer sets that header,
  and the trainer is the trusted side.

Both PEM files come from one projected volume on the pod (Step 6d). Its
`podCertificate` source has Substrate's pod identity signer issue a certificate
for the pod's ServiceAccount, with the key in the same file. Its
`clusterTrustBundle` source supplies the CA that signed the router's serving
certificate.

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | kubectl -n "${TRAIN_NS}" apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: router-client
data:
  config.yaml: |
    gateways:
      local:
        port: 8080
        bindAddress: 127.0.0.1
        protocol: HTTP
    backends:
    - name: atenet-router
      host: atenet-router.ate-system.svc:443
      policies:
        http:
          version: HTTP/1.1
        backendTLS:
          cert: /run/router-client/credential-bundle.pem
          key: /run/router-client/credential-bundle.pem
          root: /run/router-client/router-ca.pem
    routes:
    - name: to-router
      gateways:
      - local
      backends:
      - backend: /atenet-router
EOF
```

`http.version: HTTP/1.1` is there because the trainer's session is a WebSocket,
which upgrades an HTTP/1.1 connection. The training Job and the eval Job both
mount this ConfigMap.

### 6c. The environment class and trainer

This is the one piece of code the lab needs. TRL's `environment_factory`
builds one `SandboxedPython` per rollout slot:

- `reset()` binds the slot to its actor and calls OpenEnv `reset()`, which
  gives the episode a fresh interpreter.
- `run_python` and `submit_solution` are the model's tools. TRL turns every
  public method into a tool from its docstring.
- `get_reward()` is TRL's hook for an environment that owns its reward. It
  resets the session, then runs the submitted function, all of the task's
  tests, and a print of a random nonce. Reward is `1.0` only if the program
  exits cleanly **and** prints that nonce, so neither leftover state from the
  episode nor printing a fake success string can earn it.

The model sees one test (so it knows the function name and signature) and is
graded on all of them. MBPP tasks that need extra imports are filtered out,
because the interpreter's allowlist would fail them regardless of the answer.

`GenericEnvClient` talks to the server with plain dicts, so no environment code
from OpenEnv is installed or run in the trainer.

`per_device_train_batch_size` equals `NUM_ACTORS`, so each step generates
eight rollouts (two tasks, four attempts each) and TRL's pool needs exactly
eight environments, one per actor. If you change one, change the other.

### 6d. Run it

The Job runs as the `rl-client` ServiceAccount and carries the sidecar from
6b. The sidecar is an init container with `restartPolicy: Always`, which makes
it a native sidecar: it starts first, the trainer waits for its startup probe,
and it is stopped when the trainer exits, so the Job still completes.

```bash
kubectl -n "${TRAIN_NS}" logs -f job/grpo-mbpp -c trainer
```

The sidecar's own log has one line per environment connection, the `/ws`
upgrades with `http.status=101`:

```bash
kubectl -n "${TRAIN_NS}" logs job/grpo-mbpp -c router-client | grep 'http.path=/ws'
```

What you see in the trainer log, in order: the pip install, the model download into `/data/hf`,
vLLM starting inside the trainer, then one log line per step. Watch:

| Log key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `reward` / `rewards/SandboxedPython/mean` | Share of rollouts whose submission passed every test. This is the number GRPO pushes up |
| `tools/call_frequency`, `tools/failure_frequency` | How often the model used `run_python` / `submit_solution`, and how often a call errored |
| printed completion | One full rollout: the prompt, the model's code, the sandbox output, the submission |

Forty steps of a 1.7B model is a short run. Expect a noisy reward that drifts
up, not a solved benchmark. Raise `MAX_STEPS` for a longer one.

While it runs, watch the sandboxes do the work:

```bash
kubectl ate get actors -a "${ATESPACE}"
kubectl ate logs actor coder-0 -a "${ATESPACE}" -f --source containers
```

`coder-0` logs a WebSocket session and a stream of reset and step requests.
The probe's log next to it still shows nothing getting out.

```bash
kubectl -n "${TRAIN_NS}" wait --for=condition=complete job/grpo-mbpp --timeout=3h
```

The adapter is at `/data/adapter` on the PVC (`adapter_config.json`,
`adapter_model.safetensors`).

---

## Step 7: Base vs trained, through agentgateway

The Job has released the GPU. vLLM now serves the base model as `qwen3-1.7b`
and the adapter as `qwen3-1.7b-grpo` from one process.

kubectl -n "${TRAIN_NS}" exec deploy/vllm -- curl -s localhost:8000/v1/models | jq -r '.data[].id'
```

Both `qwen3-1.7b` and `qwen3-1.7b-grpo` are listed. The settings match
training: Hermes-style tool calls (Qwen3's format) and thinking off.

### 7b. agentgateway in front of vLLM

The backend leaves `model` unset, so the request's model passes through and
one route serves both names. `host` and `port` point the OpenAI provider at
vLLM instead of `api.openai.com`.

```bash

```

The Gateway is `Programmed` and the route shows `Accepted=True` and
`ResolvedRefs=True`.

### 7c. The eval

The eval runs the same loop TRL ran during training, now over HTTP: the model
answers through agentgateway, and its code runs and is graded in `coder-0`,
with the same nonce check. The eval Job reaches `coder-0` the way the trainer
did: as `rl-client`, through the same router client sidecar. It scores 40 MBPP test-split tasks the model never
trained on, at temperature 0, once per model.

Use two terminals.

**Eval result:**

```bash
kubectl -n "${TRAIN_NS}" logs -f job/eval-mbpp -c eval
```

The last two lines are the scores, `qwen3-1.7b: N/40` and
`qwen3-1.7b-grpo: N/40`. With a 40-step run the gap is small and can go
either way on 40 tasks; it is the same harness and the same sandboxes scoring
both, so a longer run's gain shows up here directly.

**agentgateway (who spent what):**

```bash
kubectl -n "${LLM_NS}" logs -l gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name="${LLM_GW}" -f \
  | grep --line-buffered 'llm.model'
```

Each eval call is one line with `llm.model=qwen3-1.7b` or
`llm.model=qwen3-1.7b-grpo` and its input and output tokens. That gives you
tokens per solved task for each model as well as the pass rate.

## Step 8: Start the next run from the golden snapshot

The eight actors have been running code from thousands of episodes. OpenEnv
`reset()` already gave each episode a fresh interpreter, but the process and
filesystem around it have lived through the whole run. Before the next run,
throw that away.

**Revert one actor** to the snapshot it was created from (the golden tag;
these actors were never suspended, so that is their last external snapshot):

```bash
kubectl ate revert actor coder-0 -a "${ATESPACE}"
kubectl ate get actor coder-0 -a "${ATESPACE}"
```

`coder-0` is `ACTOR_STATE_SUSPENDED`. The next request through the router, or
`kubectl ate resume`, restores it exactly as the golden actor was.

**Or recreate all of them**, which is what a pipeline would do per run:

```bash
for i in $(seq 0 $((NUM_ACTORS - 1))); do
  kubectl ate delete actor "coder-${i}" -a "${ATESPACE}"
  kubectl ate create actor "coder-${i}" -a "${ATESPACE}" --template coding-env
  kubectl ate resume actor "coder-${i}" -a "${ATESPACE}"
done
```

Either way, nothing a model did in run N is visible in run N+1. This closes
the cross-session persistence path from the Hugging Face incident.

## Step 9: Teardown

The GPU node bills while it exists. Delete it first if you are done.

```bash
gcloud container node-pools delete gpu-l4 \
  --cluster="${CLUSTER_NAME}" --location="${CLUSTER_LOCATION}" --project="${PROJECT_ID}" --quiet
```

Training, serving and the gateway objects:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace "${TRAIN_NS}"
kubectl -n "${LLM_NS}" delete agentgatewaypolicy "${LLM_GW}-access-log"
kubectl -n "${LLM_NS}" delete httproute vllm
kubectl -n "${LLM_NS}" delete agentgatewaybackend vllm
kubectl -n "${LLM_NS}" delete gateway "${LLM_GW}"
```

Take the trainer's identity off the router's allowlist. This is the Step 0
command with only `atenet-client` left on the list:

```bash
cd "${SUBSTRATE_DIR}"

go run ./cmd/ate-setup deploy atenet \
  --config "${INSTALL_RECORD}" \
  --ingress-allowed-spiffe-ids="spiffe://cluster.local/ns/ate-system/sa/atenet-client"
```

Substrate objects. Actors first, then templates (which also deletes their
golden actor and golden snapshot), then the empty atespace, then the pool:

```bash
for i in $(seq 0 $((NUM_ACTORS - 1))); do
  kubectl ate delete actor "coder-${i}" -a "${ATESPACE}"
done
kubectl ate delete actor redteam -a "${ATESPACE}"
kubectl ate delete actor-template coding-env -a "${ATESPACE}"
kubectl ate delete actor-template redteam -a "${ATESPACE}"
kubectl ate delete atespace "${ATESPACE}"
kubectl delete namespace "${POOL_NS}"
```
